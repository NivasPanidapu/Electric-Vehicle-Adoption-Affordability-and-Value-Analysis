# Electric Vehicle Trends & Insights in Washington State

This project analyzes **electric vehicle (EV) adoption patterns in Washington State** using an interactive analytics dashboard. The dashboard highlights trends in BEV vs PHEV adoption, regional distribution, pricing vs range tradeoffs, utility-wise EV concentration, and value-for-money insights across cities and districts.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Understand EV adoption trends over time in Washington State  
- Compare **Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV)** vs **Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV)**  
- Analyze EV distribution across **counties, cities, and utility providers**  
- Explore **price vs electric range** tradeoffs and affordability segments  
- Identify regions and models that offer the **best value for money**

## 📊 Key Insights
- BEVs account for the majority of EV registrations in Washington State, indicating a strong shift away from PHEVs.  
- EV adoption accelerated significantly after 2016, driven largely by Tesla models.  
- Urban counties (Seattle metro and surrounding regions) show the highest EV concentration.  
- Higher MSRP does not always translate to proportionally higher electric range.  
- Certain cities and districts offer better **range per dollar**, indicating stronger value-for-money for EV buyers.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI Desktop** – Interactive dashboard development  
- **Power Query** – Data cleaning and transformation  
- **DAX** – Custom measures and KPIs  
- **Bing Maps (Power BI)** – Geospatial visualization
